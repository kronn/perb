h1. PERB

h3. run httperf and save results to a database

PERB is a front-end for httperf, saving test results in a database.

Therefore you need httperf, a database and maybe some things I missed.

h2. Installation / Setup

bq. git clone git://github.com/kronn/perb.git
cd perb/
bundle install
mkdir ~/.perb
cp config/database.example.yml ~/.perb/database.yml
cp config/settings.example.yml ~/.perb/settings.yml
vim ~/.perb/*.yml
# time passes as you try to quit vim :)
rake db:migrate

h3. notes

For starters, I recommend using sqlite3. If you are not using sqlite3, please
make sure the database exists before migrating. Alternatively, you may endure
the error message and create the database before invoking @rake db:migrate@ the
second time.

The settings.yml contains a list of testable targets, so thats the main
configuration you want to make.

h2. Invocation

bq. cd /path/to/perb
bin/perb

Then, check your DB for results

h2. Contributors

The initial work has been done by Chris Flöß and Johannes Strampe.

h2. Forks/Patches/Stuff

You cannot fork, patch and improve this project.
It's just technically impossible.
Even I can't. Noone can.

You may, however, try it and prove me wrong.

h2. LICENSE

I haven't found a license in the original repo, but I release my changes MIT-Licensed.
