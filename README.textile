h1. PERB

h3. run httperf and save results to a database

PERB is a front-end for httperf, saving test results in a database.

Therefore you need httperf, a database and maybe some things I missed.

h2. Installation / Setup

  mkdir ~/.perb
  cp config/database.example.yml ~/.perb/database.yml
  cp config/settings.example.yml ~/.perb/settings.yml
  vim ~/.perb/*.yml
  # time passes as you try to quit vim :)

h3. notes

For starters, I recommend using sqlite3.

The settings.yml contains a list of testable targets, so thats the main
configuration you want to make.

h2. Invocation

  cd /path/to/perb
  bin/perb

Then, check your DB for results

h2. Contributors

The initial work has been done by Chris Flöß and Johannes Strampe.

h2. Forks/Patches/Stuff

You cannot fork, patch and improve this project.
It's just technically impossible.
Even I can't. Noone can.

You may, however, try it and prove me wrong.

h2. LICENSE

I haven't found a license in the original repo, but I release my changes MIT-Licensed.
